# 🩺 Medical Note De-Identification using Transformer Models

- This project focuses on the automatic de-identification of sensitive medical information from clinical notes using transformer-based NLP models like ClinicalBERT and RoBERTa. The goal is to ensure privacy by removing Protected Health Information (PHI) from electronic health records while maintaining the medical context.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 Automatically detects and masks PHI (e.g., patient names, dates, locations)

- 🤖 Uses domain-specific models like ClinicalBERT for higher accuracy in medical contexts

- 🧠 Built using Hugging Face Transformers

- 🧪 Supports inference on both local environments and Hugging Face Spaces

- 📊 Streamlit-based interactive UI for demo and testing
